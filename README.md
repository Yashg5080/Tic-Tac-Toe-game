This is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game designed using the concepts of  very basic, Python. This game only contains some basic functions and if-else concepts.There is a slight use of random and time module.There are basically three modes available in the game which are as follows:-

* ***If you press 1***
      
     If you press 1 and hit enter the program will ask for names of player1 and player2. After writing names the following screen turns up which will tell whose turn it is (Generally the first player breakes).You have to simply choose the numbers from 1 to 9 and hit enter and it will replace the number with 'X' or '0'. You will see the following output when you run it to this step.

## Error Handling
* If you enter wrong number i.e. numbers other than 1 to 9 then it will discard that move and you have to enter the number again
* If you try to overwrite the move then too it will discard the move and you have to enter again.
